<p>My interest in I.T. is largely centered around security, both in the physical form (Traditional security hardware, systems &amp; programming) and in the cyber form as many access control and building management systems are now interconnected with other systems and accessible online. My interest in I.T. began as a teenager when my step-father brought a Commodore VIC-20 for the family as a means of bringing us together and forming a common interest. My I.T. experience is varied and spans many decades, from building P.C's and using PLC's, to developing BBS's in the early days (Pre the WWW) to publishing websites in the modern era. My knowledge has been built up largely "on-the-job" though I did do some formal training in relation to N.C. Machines when I was an Apprentice Fitter &amp; Machinist.</p>
<p>I chose to study at RMIT as I believe it is the premier institution in Australia in regards to modern I.T. and associated systems. The fact that RMIT deliver a vast array of their coarses online was also key to my decision.</p>
<p>I expect that at the end of this coarse I will have a solid understanding of where I.T. is headed in the years to come and how my aspirations might fit into that future. In addition I hope it allows to me network with individuals who have similar interests and goals.</p>
