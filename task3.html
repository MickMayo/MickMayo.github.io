<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"> <span style="color: #800000;">Auditory:</span> 25% <span style="color: #800000;">Visual:</span> 30% <span style="color: #800000;">Tactile:</span> 45%</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ffffff;">I am a Tactile learner!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Tactile If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. You understand and remember things through physical movement. You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some type of physical activity is involved. You need to be active and take frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and with gestures, and you may have difficulty sitting still. As a tactile learner, you like to take things apart and put things together, and you tend to find reasons to tinker or move around when you become bored. You may be very well coordinated and have good athletic ability. You can easily remember things that were done but may have difficulty remembering what you saw or heard in the process. You often communicate by touching, and you appreciate physically expressed forms of encouragement, such as a pat on the back. Here are some things that tactile learners like you can do to learn better:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Participate in activities that involve touching, building, moving, or drawing. Do lots of hands-on activities like completing art projects, taking walks, or acting out stories. It's OK to chew gum, walk around, or rock in a chair while reading or studying. Use flashcards and arrange them in groups to show relationships between ideas. Trace words with your finger to learn spelling (finger spelling). Take frequent breaks during reading or studying periods (frequent, but not long). It's OK to tap a pencil, shake your foot, or hold on to something while learning. Use a computer to reinforce learning through the sense of touch.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Remember that you learn best by doing, not just by reading, seeing, or hearing.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><em><u>What do the results of these tests mean to me?</u></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The results reinforce some elements of my personality and abilities which I have identified throughout my life, and highlight some things I hadn't really considered.&nbsp; Overall they allowed me to better understand why I make the choices or do the things I do.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><em><u>How do I think these results might influence my behaviour in a team?</u></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The results show me as a somewhat natural leader, a role I have never really been comfortable in, they may well give me added confidence to perform that role.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong><em><u>How should I take this into consideration when forming a team? </u></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Understanding my own traits ie: strengths &amp; weaknesses, should allow me to better find people who compliment those strengths and weaknesses, which overall would make the team stronger &amp; more flexible.</p>
