<p>The position above deals with all aspects of modern networking including but limited to developing, supporting, documenting, monitoring and maintaining the data, voice and video communications infrastructure. It includes project based work, collaboration with other teams and maintaining quality standards.</p>
<p>The position appeals to many on many levels. As I have spent most of my working life in the security industry installing end of network hardware &amp; integrating intruder alarm, CCTV, duress, intercom &amp; access control systems with other building management systems, I know first hand how important it is to have high-speed &amp; reliable backbone networks. Without quality networks many systems regardless of how good they are in a stand-alone sense, are unable to be fully utilised. The ability to integrate many systems seamlessly over TCP/IP gives rise to huge gains in productivity for the client. This position puts me at the tip of the sword in regards to delivering highly efficient and truelly integrated outcomes for business. As I am studying both I.T. &amp; Management, the role allows me to fully exercise both skill sets.</p>
<p>The position requires a diverse range of skills these include the ability to work closely with others in a team enviroment, the ability to analyse complex systems and find ways to optimise &amp; expand those systems. Be able to deliver integrated automation in the most useable or user friendly way possible. Be able to develop &amp; design networks, from the optic fibre that connects them to the routers and switches that control them, in addition a good understanding of the systems that utilise them. A Bachelor of I.T. degree whilst not specifically required will no doubt be a great advantage, in addition to a solid understanding of business concepts and processes.</p>
<p>I currently posses many of the skills outlined above, these I have largely gained on the job and via industry certifications on various security products.</p>
<p><u>I am certified on the following;</u></p>
<p><strong>Gallagher</strong> (Cardax Professional / Integrator / Advanced Network Deployment)</p>
<p><strong>Inner Range </strong>(Concept Certified Installer / Certified Advanced Technician)</p>
<p><strong>Interlogix </strong>(Tecom Forcefield Enterprise Installer / Tecom Installer / Advanced Titan Technician / Forcefield Enterprise Integrator)</p>
<p><strong>Geutabruk</strong> (Reporter / Mutiscope DVR System Installer /&nbsp; Integrator / VIPCAM Integrator /&nbsp; Advanced Video Analytics Deployment &amp; Integration / Motion Detection / Thermal Image Capture / Camera Position Authentication / Number Plate Recognition / Alarm Integration / Surveillance Counter Measures)</p>
<p><strong>AXIS </strong>(Advanced CCTV Technician / I.P. Network Integration / Remote Access &amp; Deployment)</p>
<p><strong>Hills</strong> (MATV / SAT / FTA Technician)</p>
<p>In regards to building on the above, I intend to complete 2 undergraduate courses, one in Information Technology and the other in Business Concepts. This will give me a pathway toward a Bachelor of I.T. degree, giving me a good mix of formal understanding and hands on experience.</p>
